A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,

## How to play
This is a simple arcade game. Your objective is to collect as much Treats as you can before yout time limit reaches 0!  
Amidst those treats are some Tricks disguised as happy pumpkins, and you guessed it, those should be avoided!

Your controls are <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> to move your character left and right.

Treats are worth 1pt each, while Tricks are -3pt. Be prepared! You'll have 45 seconds to catch 'em all!

## Jam details
Our theme is Halloween and the chosen limitation is "Be ridiculously happy and colorful".
